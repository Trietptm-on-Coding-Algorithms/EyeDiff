VMWare ESXi, formerly known as ESX, is an enterprise-class, type-1 hypervisor developed by VMWare
for deploying and serving virtual computers.

After version 4.1 (released in 2010), VMWare renamed ESX to ESXi. ESXi replaces Service Console
with a more closely integrated OS.

Login:

You might find a login portal on port 443, which can be brute-forced by this Metasploit Framework
module:

* auxiliary/scanner/vmware/vmware_http_login

If vCenter is available (try port 5480), it might be a default username and password:

* root:vmware
* root:123456

Other modules:

If you're lucky, this directory traversal module might also work for you against the target:

* auxiliary/scanner/vmware/vmware_server_dir_trav

Other useful Metasploit Framework modules that you could use:

* auxiliary/scanner/vmware/esx_fingerprint
* auxiliary/scanner/vmware/vmware_enum_permissions
* auxiliary/scanner/vmware/vmware_enum_users
* auxiliary/scanner/vmware/vmware_enum_vms
