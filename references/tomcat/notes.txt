Apache Tomcat, also known as Tomcat Server, is an open-source Java Servlet Container developed by
the Apache Software Foundation. Tomcat implements several Java EE specifications including Java
Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java EL, and WebSocket, and provides a "pure Java" HTTP web
server environment in which Java code can run.

Apache Tomcat Passwords:

Apache Tomcat is often a valuable target for penetration testing, because if you manage to find
the administrator's password, you can upload a malicious war file from tomcat, and gain
arbitrary remote code execution.

Older versions of Tomcats came with default passwords, for example:

tomcat:tomcat as tomcat
role1:tomcat as role1
both:tomcat as tomcat and role1
admin:admin as manager

Newer versions of Tomcats require the admin to set a password in order to use it. If you are up
against this type of Tomcat, then you may consider using a brute-force module, such as the
following module from Metasploit:

* auxiliary/scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login

Apache Tomcat Exploits:

The Metasploit Framework currently contains two useful exploit modules against Tomcat:

* exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_deploy
* exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload

Other Metasploit modules that exploit applications that run on top of Tomcat, if you can find them:

* exploit/multi/http/struts2_content_type_ognl
* exploit/multi/http/struts_code_exec
* exploit/multi/http/struts_code_exec_classloader
* exploit/multi/http/struts_code_exec_exception_delegator
* exploit/multi/http/struts_code_exec_parameters
* exploit/multi/http/struts_default_action_mapper
* exploit/multi/http/struts_dev_mode
* exploit/multi/http/struts_dmi_exec
* exploit/multi/http/struts_dmi_rest_exec
* exploit/multi/http/struts_include_params
* exploit/multi/http/struts_dev_mode
* exploit/multi/http/axis2_deployer
* exploit/multi/http/apache_roller_ognl_injection


Apache Tomcat Post-Exploitation:

The following Metasploit module can be used to collect Tomcat credentials:

* post/multi/gather/tomcat_gather
